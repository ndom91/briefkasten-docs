title: Setup
---

You can self-host Briefkasten with Docker and docker-compose. The setup is split into two docker-compose files, depending on how much you want to self-host, and how many cloud services you'd like to use.

1. `docker-compose.yml` - Contains the frontend and backend of the application.
2. `docker-compose.storage.yml` - Contains a PostgreSQL container as well as a Minio object store container.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository to your server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ndom91/briefkasten.git
```

2. Setup the environment variables.

Make a copy of the two `.env.example` files and fill in at least the required variables with your favorite text editor. The example files have annotations for the variables.

1. `apps/web/.env.example`
2. `apps/backend/.env.example`

| Directory     | Variable       | Value                                                                   |
| :------------ | :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web + Backend | `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/postgres`                  |
| Web           | `AUTH_URL`     | Your current URL (i.e. `http://localhost:3000`)                         |
| Web           | `AUTH_SECRET`  | Set to the output of `openssl rand -hex 33`                             |
| Web           | `WORKER_URL`   | URL of the `backend` application, (i.e. `http://localhost:8000/api/v0`) |
| Backend       | `JWT_SECRET`   | The same secret as you set in your web's `AUTH_SECRET`                  |

3. If you want to use the storage containers, you'll want to change some of the default credentials in the `docker-compose.storage.yml` file. For more details, check out the [Object Storage](#object-storage) and [Database](#database) sections below.

4. Finally, you can spin up the containers

Only the application containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The application containers and storage containers:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.storage.yml up -d
```

5. Now your application and database should be up and running at the default `http://localhost:3000`!

You can continue by putting `localhost:3000` behind a reverse proxy (i.e. `nginx` or `traefik`). There is an example `nginx` configuration file in `/configs/nginx-example.conf`.

## Parts

### Database

To setup the PostgreSQL database, checkout out the `postgres` service in the `docker-compose.storage.yml` file. We can bring up that database separately with the following command.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.storage.yml up database
```

### Object Storage

The default object storage provider is Cloudflare R2 as it has a free plan with 10GB storage, no egress fees. But if you'd like to self-host this, I included a [minio](https://min.io)-based setup in the `docker-compose.storage.yml` file. You can start it separately with the following command. Make sure to update the `MINIO_ROOT_USER` and `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variables in the `docker-compose.storage.yml` file, this will be your bucket access key and secret key, respectively, as well as the login for the minio console (available in the container at port `9001`).

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.storage.yml up mc minio
```
