<Callout icon="ðŸš€" type="info" title="Briefkasten v2">
  We're working on a total rewrite of Briefkasten and plan on releasing this
  `v2` soon. If you want to follow along, get alerted to any updates, or submit
  some feature requests or complaints, please check out this [GitHub Discussion
  thread](https://github.com/ndom91/briefkasten/discussions/65).

The below docs are in preparation for that. If you're looking for the v1 docs, check out the [v1 Docs](https://v1.docs.briefkastenhq.com) link in the nav bar.

Welcome to Briefkasten! Your home for bookmarks and links of all kinds.

There are two ways to use Briefkasten at the moment.

1. **Briefkasten Cloud** - [Beta Instance](https://dev.briefkastenhq.com)
2. **Selfhosted Instance** - [Selfhosting Guide](/docs/self-hosting)

<Callout>
  We intend to always run the cloud instance **for free** without any
  unreasonable limits. However, if it begins to be abused or becomes too
  expensive to host, etc. then we reserve the right to shutdown or begin
  imposing limits.
</Callout>

### Once v2 is stable, we will wipe the temporary development database active there now and migrate all data from the current v1 to v2

## Briefkasten Cloud

If you want to use the cloud version of Briefkasten, v2 is available in **beta** at [dev.briefkastenhq.com](https://dev.briefkastenhq.com). v1 is still available at [briefkastenhq.com](https://briefkastenhq.com).

## Selfhosting

To host the Briefkasten application yourself, please visit the [self-hosting](/docs/self-hosting) section for more details. There is a `docker-compose` setup which should make self-hosting it a breeze.
