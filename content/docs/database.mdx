# Database

The Briefkasten database is based on PostgreSQL and is managed using Prisma. The database schema is defined in the `schema.prisma` file and is used to generate the database schema and client. The database lives in its own packages in the monorepo, under `packages/db/*`, where the code is shared among both the webapp and api server.

The full database schema can be found in the repository under [`/prisma/schema.prisma`](https://github.com/ndom91/briefkasten/blob/main/prisma/schema.prisma)

  Prisma comes with a little development database viewer, which is available via
  the npm script `db:studio` in `packages/db`.
