# Database

The Briefkasten database is built on PostgreSQL and Prisma as the ORM. The database schema is defined in the `prisma/schema.prisma` file and is used to generate the database schema and client. Alongside the database client, we also auto-generate Zod schemas for runtime validation of inputs of various kinds.
