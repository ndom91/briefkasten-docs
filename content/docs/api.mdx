Briefkasten comes with a REST API reachable at `https://briefkastenhq.com/api/**`. These are based on [Next.js API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) and the code can be found under `/src/pages/api/**/*`.

## Authentication

To authenticate to these routes, you must pass the user API Token as the `Authorization` Header. For example:

```js {9-11}
const result = await axios.post(
  "https://briefkastenhq.com/api/bookmarks",
  {
    url: "https://reddit.com",
    tags: "web",
    title: "Reddit",
  },
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: "ABC123DEF456",
    },
  },
)
```
