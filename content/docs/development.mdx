title: Development

To begin local development, you'll need a copy of the code and a local database.

## Code

The code is setup as a monorepo and contains the following pieces.

1. The web app
2. The backend workers and additional API
3. The (shared) Prisma database package

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ndom91/briefkasten
cd briefkasten
```

### 2. Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will install the dependencies for the entier workspaces, i.e. all three packages.

### 3. Environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
```

Now that you have the `.env` file open in an editor, you'll want to modify the following values:

| Variable       | Value                                                                    |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/postgres`                   |
| `AUTH_URL`     | Set to your current local development URL (i.e. `http://localhost:3000`) |
| `AUTH_SECRET`  | Set to the output of `openssl rand -hex 33`                              |

If you want to setup an OAuth login provider, you will also need to add the appropriate environment variables. Like `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`/`AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` for the GitHub provider. For more login methods, please check out the [Auth.js docs](https://authjs.dev).

## Database

Next, to work on the application locally, we'll want to setup a PostgreSQL database. Check out the `postgres` service in the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of the `ndom91/briefkasten` repository. We can bring up that database with the following command.

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres
```

Next, once the database container is up and running, we need to run the initial prisma migrations to apply our schema to the database.

```bash
pnpm exec prisma migrate dev
# or
npx prisma migrate
```

## Dev Server

Once you've got the database prepared and all dependencies installed, you can start the dev server in the root of the repository.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will execute both the web app as well as the backend development servers in parallel.

<Callout>
  Prisma comes with a little development database viewer, which is available via
  the npm script `db:studio` in `packages/db`.
