When you first get logged on, you'll want to probably [add some bookmarks](#adding-bookmarks). If you've already exported some bookmarks from a browser or another bookmarking service like Pocket, you can also [import your bookmarks](#importing-bookmarks) from other services.

Next, you can add some [RSS feeds](#rss-feeds) to always stay up-to-date with your favourite sites.

Check out the available keyboard shortcuts with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>?</kbd> and start exploring the application.

## Adding Bookmarks

There are a few options to add bookmarks. If you want to create a new bookmark entry, you have the following options.

### Quick add

import QuickAdd from "../../public/screenshots/quick-add.png"

<Screenshot src={QuickAdd} alt="Quick Add" />

The quick add modal allows you to manually type in any desired information, including of course the URL to the website you wish to save. While saving the bookmark, we will fetch a current screenshot of the desired page and save it alongside the page details.

Open it by pressing the `+` button in the bottom right of the application or using the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> keyboard shortcut.

### Drag-n-Drop

import DragNDrop from "../../public/screenshots/dragndrop.png"

<Screenshot src={DragNDrop} alt="Drag and Drop Add" />

In addition to manually typing in all the required information, you can simply drag and drop any URL onto the Briefkasten application page and we'll fetch the basic title, description, and page screenshot for you. Remember, you can manually edit any of those values later after it's been saved.

Alternatively, you can paste a URL into the app by simply focusing the page and pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>. You'll then be prompted with the above modal to confirm the details before saving.
