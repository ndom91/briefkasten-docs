title: Development
---

To begin local development, you'll need a copy of the code and a local database.

## Code

The code is setup as a monorepo and contains the following pieces.

1. `apps/web` - The web app
2. `apps/backend` - The backend workers and additional API

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ndom91/sveltekasten
cd sveltekasten
```

### 2. Dependencies

In the root of the repository, running this command will install the dependencies for the entier workspaces, i.e. both packages / applications.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Environment variables

Next, you'll want to setup the environment variables. Because this is a monorepo, there are 2 different environment variables files you'll need to make copies of.

Run the following command for these files

```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
```

1. `apps/web/.env.example`
1. `apps/backend/.env.example`

Open your `.env` files in an editor and modify at least the following values. These are the required values.

| Directory     | Variable       | Value                                                                   |
| :------------ | :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web + Backend | `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/postgres`                  |
| Web           | `AUTH_URL`     | Your current URL (i.e. `http://localhost:3000`)                         |
| Web           | `AUTH_SECRET`  | Set to the output of `openssl rand -hex 33`                             |
| Web           | `WORKER_URL`   | URL of the `backend` application, (i.e. `http://localhost:8000/api/v0`) |
| Backend       | `JWT_SECRET`   | The same secret as you set in your web's `AUTH_SECRET`                  |

Next, you'll want to setup at least 1 [Authentication Provider](https://authjs.dev) with Auth.js-related environment variables. We support OAuth providers like Github, Google, Azure, Keycloak and Authentik as well as the Email "Magic Link" provider out of the box. See the `apps/web/.env.example` for the various environment variables you can set.

In addition, you can tell the backend to save the bookmarks images to a [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/) bucket instead of to the disk, by filling in the `BUCKET_*` environment variables in the backends `apps/backend/.env` file. I only tested with Cloudflare R2, but any S3 compatible object store should work.

## Database

Next, to work on the application locally, we'll want to setup a PostgreSQL database. Check out the `postgres` service in the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of the `ndom91/briefkasten` repository. We can bring up that database with the following command.

```bash
docker-compose up --profile postgres database
```

## Dev Server

Once you've got the database prepared and all dependencies installed, you can start the dev servers by running the `dev` npm script in the root of the repository.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will execute both the web app as well as the backend development servers in parallel. The web app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend at `http://localhost:8000/api/v0`, unless you changed the default URLs.
