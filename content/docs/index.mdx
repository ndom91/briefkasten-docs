<Callout icon="ðŸš€" type="info" title="Briefkasten v2">
  We're working on a total rewrite of Briefkasten and plan on releasing this
  `v2` soon. If you want to follow along, get alerted to any updates, or submit
  some feature requests or complaints, please check out this [GitHub Discussion
  thread](https://github.com/ndom91/briefkasten/discussions/65).

The below docs are in preparation for that. If you're looking for the v1 docs, check out the [v1 Docs](https://v1.docs.briefkastenhq.com) link in the nav bar.

Welcome to Briefkasten! Your home for bookmarks and links of all kinds.

There are two ways to use Briefkasten at the moment.

1. **Briefkasten Cloud**
2. **Selfhosted Instance**

<Callout>
  We intend to always run the cloud instance without any sort of unreasonable
  limits **for free**. However, if it begins to be abused or becomes too
  expensive, too much work, etc. we reserve the right to shutdown or begin
  imposing limits!
</Callout>

## Briefkasten Cloud

If you want to use the cloud version of Briefkasten, v2 is available in **beta** at [dev.briefkastenhq.com](https://dev.briefkastenhq.com). You can still signup and use v1 at [briefkastenhq.com](https://briefkastenhq.com).

**Once v2 is stable, I will wipe the temporary development database and migrate all data from v1 to v2**

## Selfhosting

To host the Briefkasten application yourself, please visit the [self-hosting](/docs/self-hosting) section for more details. There is a `docker-compose` setup which should make self-hosting it a breeze.
